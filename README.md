# 2023 StackOverflow Survey Data Analysis

This project provides an in-depth exploration of the 2023 StackOverflow survey data. It offers a comprehensive understanding of the coding community's characteristics, preferences, and sentiments. 

## Overview

The project begins by setting up the necessary libraries and loading the data. It then delves into the demographics of the respondents, exploring their geographical distribution and total count.

The relationship of the respondents with coding is analyzed next, uncovering insights about their coding experience and remote work preferences. The project also investigates the correlation between coding experience and compensation, and how these vary across different developer types, age groups, and educational backgrounds.

The learning methods adopted by the respondents to learn coding, the top-paying companies, and the popularity of JavaScript are also explored. The project also looks into the usage of WhatsApp for work-related purposes.

A key aspect of this project is the exploration of the impact of AI. This includes understanding the sentiments of respondents towards AI, the AI tools currently in use or of interest for potential use, the most important benefits of AI, and the level of trust in AI among respondents.
